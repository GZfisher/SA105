    Normality
      Dependent variable should be normally distributed within each group
    Homogeneity of variances
      Variances should be similar among groups
    Independence
      Covariate should be independent from group factor
    Linearity
      Linear relationship between covariate and dependent variable
    Homogeneity of regression slopes
      Regression slopes should be equal across groups
    Covariate type
      Preferably continuous
      Categorical variable can be set as dummy variable if needed
